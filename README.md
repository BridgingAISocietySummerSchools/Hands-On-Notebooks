# ML workshop: hands-on jupyter notebooks

This repository is a collection of jupyter notebooks to teach you the basics of machine learning. They provide easy access to code example that can be run out-of-the-box and insights into the most basic machine-learning algorithms.

If you are unfamiliar with installing python and python packages on your computer, you might want to check out the [installation instructions][INSTALLATION.md]. In the instructions, we give a step-by-step guidance how to install the _anaconda_ package management system on your computer.


## Getting started

Anaconda is our recommended way to install and maintain python on your system. If you have a python installation already and do not need the guidance through anaconda, the following section gives a brief overview how to get started. If you have followed the above installation instructions for anaconda, the section below will guide you through setting up these notebooks on your computer step by step. In that case, you can skip the next paragraphs.

### Setup without anaconda (experts)

If you have a working installation already, or if you're familiar enough with python and python package managing, you can just skip the above installation step. Make sure you have the [required packages](ml-environment.yml) installed in a recent version. These include:
* numpy, scipy
* matplotlib, seaborn
* pandas
* sklearn
* tensorflow

You can then get started by either clicking on the individual notebooks to view them, or use the slightly more comfortable [notebook viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/knutzk/ml-workshop/). To work on the notebooks yourself and to execute the code cells, make a clone of the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/knutzk/ml-workshop.git
```

Then, start a jupyter notebook kernel by opening a shell and typing:

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

This opens a browser tab. Navigate to the `ml-workshop` folder and get started with the notebooks.

### Setup with anaconda (recommended)
