A curated collection of **Jupyter notebooks** to explore and teach the fundamentals of **machine learning**. These notebooks are practical, beginner-friendly, and support our interdisciplinary summer school curriculum.


## 🚀 Quick Start

You can run all notebooks in your browser via **Google Colab** — no installation required:
👉 [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BridgingAISocietySummerSchools/Hands-On-Notebooks/)

To run notebooks locally (e.g. via Anaconda, Docker, or virtual environments), follow the instructions in:
📄 [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)


## 📘 What’s Inside?

These notebooks are designed to:

- Introduce essential machine learning concepts using real code
- Support hands-on sessions in our summer school programs
- Encourage experimentation and interdisciplinary exploration

They are designed from scratch but build on best practices and widely used teaching patterns.
We recommend the book below as a **complementary reference** for deeper dives and additional examples:

**Aurélien Géron – _Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow_ (3rd ed., O'Reilly 2022)**
