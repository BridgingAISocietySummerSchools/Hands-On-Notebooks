    "- \"Is the patient's temperature above 38°C?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is:\n",
    "- ✅ Interpretable (you can follow every decision),\n",
    "- ❌ Assumption-free (no need to assume linearity),\n",
    "- 🔀 Flexible (works with numbers, categories, and missing data),\n",
    "- 🧠 Intuitive (mimics how we reason about choices).\n",
