    "By 'taking the best of both worlds', the _mini-batch gradient descent_ might be the perfect compromise between BGD and SGD. Instead of taking all or just one instance, the gradient is evaluated on a _mini-batch_ of instances. This makes it a little more stable than SGD, especially with large mini-batches. And it allows for vectorisation optimisations in terms of computing. It has the same 'issue' as SGD, however, that it never stops at the optimal values for the estimators, but keeps jumping around the global minimum. Therefore, a good learning schedule is pivotal to implement this technique successfully."
